# Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)

This folder contains the specific files for the Chrome Extension, which uses the Manifest V3 format.

## Build

To build the Chrome extension, run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build:chromeExt
```

This will generate a zip file in the `dist/web/build` directory, which can then be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store.
