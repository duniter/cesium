# June-Cheque-App

June-Cheque-App is a web application where you can easily cash cheques created by the [June-Cheque](https://github.com/paolomaria/june-cheque) project.

It has been forked from the [Cesium](https://github.com/duniter/cesium) project and the not needed parts have been removed.

It can be built like described in the [Cesium](https://github.com/duniter/cesium) project.

Only the unhosted web application package has been tested.

**IMPORTANT**: this project is still experimental. Use it at your own risk !!
