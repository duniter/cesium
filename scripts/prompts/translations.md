## Chat GPT prompt for translations

I need translations for the following messages in a web application, in these languages/locales: en, en-GB, de-DE, eo-EO, es-CT, es-ES, it-IT, nl-NL, pt-PT. Please follow these constraints: maintain the input JSON format, indentation, and message keys; preserve HTML tags and case; and keep proper nouns untranslated (e.g., "Duniter" and "Cesium"). Here is the source message in French:
```json
"ORIGINAL_KEY_UNCHANGED": "<your_translation>"
```

Please provide the translations for each language/locale in this format:

- <language_code> (e.g., en, en-GB, ...):
```json
{
"ORIGINAL_KEY_UNCHANGED": "<your_translation>"
}
```

If you have any questions before starting, please ask for clarifications to avoid mistakes.
